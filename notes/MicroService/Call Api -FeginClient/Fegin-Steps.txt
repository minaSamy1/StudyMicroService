- as we know the useful of Fegin which use to call RestServices from other service project
   

   +Steps to call other Services 

       1- in pom.ml 
            <dependency>
                <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
                <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-openfeign</artifactId>
            </dependency>

     2- in Main Class will enable Fegin by using   @EnableFeignClients

     3- Create Interface which consider as proxy where we define 
        which service we will call from it   


        //@FeignClient(name="dasdadasd",url="localhost:8000")    /// while using static  URL 
        @FeignClient(name="currency-exchange-service")   ///   ( Using Naming Server  Eurka )  kindly note we write the service name which is Eurka
            public interface CurrencyExchangeProxy {


                @GetMapping("/currency-exchange/from/{from}/to/{to}")
                public CurrencyConversion retriveRate(@PathVariable String from, @PathVariable String to);
            }


       4- in the class while we will consume the the external Service by Fogin 

                   CurrencyConversion currencyExchangeResponse = exchangeServiceProxy.retriveRate(from, to);
